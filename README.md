## 1. Docker (Chef) Rules

Located in the `/docker` directory, these rules define best practices and security standards for Docker containers managed with Chef.

## 2. Terraform (OPA) Policies

The `/terraform/vm` directory contains Open Policy Agent (OPA) policies for Terraform. These policies enforce infrastructure-as-code standards and security best practices.

## 3. Helm (OPA) Policies

Helm chart policies using OPA can be found in the `/helm/availability` directory. These ensure that Kubernetes deployments via Helm adhere to organizational standards and security requirements.

## 4. Policy Violation Fix Script

The `pull-request-fix.py` script in the root directory uses ChatGPT to intelligently suggest fixes for policy violations. 

## 5. Azure Policy Continuous Tests

Located in the `/azure-policies` directory, these tests ensure that Azure Policies are functioning as expected. They can be integrated into your CI/CD pipeline for continuous validation.
